# Excel Data Anonymizer

### Description:
This utility is designed for data scientists and analysts who require draft datasets derived from original data without compromising privacy. With the Excel Data Anonymizer, users can generate a randomized version of their datasets, ensuring that the essential structures remain while the actual data values are altered. This utility is particularly handy when sharing datasets for public demos, examples, or initial stages of analysis where raw data can't be disclosed.

### Features:
- **Randomize Data**: Produces randomized values for numeric columns within a reasonable range of the original values, preserving the general structure and relationships in the data.
- **Preserve Formulas**: Cells containing formulas in the Excel sheet are kept intact, ensuring that the logic and calculations in the original data are not lost.
- **Intuitive GUI**: Offers an interactive and user-friendly interface, simplifying the anonymization process for users of all experience levels.
